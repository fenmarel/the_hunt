## The Hunt

A simple job application tracking system.  Why use a spreadsheet when you could use a pretty web app?  No reason, that's why.

TODO:
* add contact info on job applications, maybe a notes section, viewable in job application show (which doesn't exist yet), more info in general
* add running counts for current pending and rejections
* make some better page titles
* email validation/password retrieval
* add rejection by time expiration, subtable in user rejections, maybe by cleanup button? automatic?
* buttons to job search sites, maybe a customizable button list
